<center><h2> HOW TO USE TOOL </h2></center>
<b>Description</b><br>
This tool uses Integer Linear Programming (ILP) in finding an optimal gene cluster provided a set of genomes and formulation
constraints as input. It also allows the use of LP relaxation which speeds up the process a little although the corresponding results might not be the best given the input constraints. 

<b>Input Constraints</b><br>
The input constraints included are: <br>
<ul>
	<li>Formulation</li>
	<li>Range</li>
	<li>Weights for Additional and Missing Genes</li>
	<li>Gap Size <i>(optional)</i></li>
	<li>k Size <i>(optional)</i></li> 
</ul> 

The definition of each is in the <i>Data Constraints</i> tab. <br>

The user provides an input CSV file and will be able to preview the transformed data. 
The user will be able to change the define the formulation and input constraints and proceed in viewing the results.
